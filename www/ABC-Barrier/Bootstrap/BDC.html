    <div class="heading1">U-bar Connection</div>

    <p class="bbc">The first barrier to deck connection was designed to be easily constructed and repaired as well as durable. This detail includes a steel piece embedded into the bridge deck so it would work best with new construction. The barrier would then be placed on the bridge deck and a reinforcing rod would get inserted into the precast barrier at an incline. The steel rod has a threaded end and gets threaded into the piece embedded in the bridge deck. Through calculations this design was shown to meet the structural capacity of the desired test level 4. With this connection, there is no steel hardware exposed to the elements. The inclined rods could be stainless steel to help make them more durable. Since the main connection piece would already be in place in the bridge deck the connection detail would be relatively simple to construct. Upon impact, this barrier system was designed to fail in the inclined rod near the connection. This would make for an easier repair.</p>
 
 
 
   <p class="bbc">Only the damaged barrier segments would need to be removed and replaced versus the entire bridge barrier. Also, with the failure in the connecting rod, this would limit the damage done to the bridge deck. However, this concept may be limited in other areas. Due to the specially made pieces within the deck and the stainless steel rods, this connection may not be very cost effective.<p>

   <div class="heading1">Inclined Connection</div>
  <p class="bbc">The second connection detail between the barrier and the bridge deck was designed based on cost effectiveness and durability. The detail includes a stainless steel u-shaped rebar that gets inserted vertically through pockets in the bridge deck and precast barrier. . Through calculations this design was shown to meet the structural capacity of the desired test level 4. There is no exposed steel hardware in this connection. The u-shaped bar is stainless steel to help make the connection system more durable. Through the use of simple steel hardware, this connection concept is considered the cheaper option. </p>
