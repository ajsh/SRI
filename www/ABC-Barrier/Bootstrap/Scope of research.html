Scope of research
</div>
<p class="bbc">This research contains several components.  The initial task included a national literature search to review all cast-in-place and prefabricated barrier designs and details including anchorage systems that have been crash tested for use on the national highway system.  The search also included a survey distributed to state DOTâ€™s to determine their needs related to prefabricated concrete bridge barriers. </p>


<p class="bbc">Based upon the results of the literature search, conceptual designs of prefabricated barriers with associated anchorage systems and details were developed.  Although the ultimate goal was to develop a system that can be adopted for multiple barrier shapes, only on profile shape was selected in this experimental program.  Two concepts for connecting the barrier to the bridge deck were designed for testing and one detail for connecting to adjacent barriers were conceptualized.  </p>
<p class="bbc">The laboratory testing was conducted on two full-scale test barriers.  Lab tests involved quasi-static loading and ponding tests for durability.  The barrier systems were evaluated based on how they impacted their individual strengths and how they impacted the performance of the bridge deck overhangs used to support the railing.</p>
