Research Expertise and Interest:  Cameron's research studies applied problems in risk and decision analysis, with a particular emphasis on large-scale disruptions. His expertise includes operations research, systems engineering, optimization, simulation, decision theory, and multi-attribute utility theory. He has applied his models to Hurricane Sandy, the Japanese tsunami, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and Hurricane Katrina. The goal of this research is to model the risk of disruptive events and the impact of those disruptive events in order to better understand how to prepare and respond to these events. His decision models help determine when and where resources should be allocated before, during, and after a disruption in order to increase the resilience of communities, organizations, and infrastructure systems.
 
Cameron and a colleague at the Naval Postgraduate School developed a web-based simulation tool to help the Marine Corps Reserves train on preparing for hurricanes. The Marine Corps Reserves are headquartered in New Orleans, and they are currently using this simulation as part of their training exercises for hurricanes. The simulation teaches them how to interpret and understand the uncertainty in hurricanes and think about the trade-offs in preparation decisions for hurricanes.
