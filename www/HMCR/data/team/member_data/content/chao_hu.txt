Research Expertise and Interest: Chao Hu studies design for failure resilience of engineered systems that integrates design of reliable system functions and robust failure prognostics in a unified design framework. Resilience defines the ability of an engineered system to sense and withstand adverse events such as internal degradation and external hazard events, and to recover from the effects of the adverse events. In recent years, prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques have emerged to detect, diagnose, predict, and manage the system-wide effects of adverse events. Capitalizing on these techniques in the early design stage enables the transformation of passively reliable, vulnerable systems into adaptively reliable, resilient systems. Specifically, Chao's research focuses on three research thrusts: (i) Developing new methods for predictive resilience analysis; (ii) Discovering the relationship between resilience, reliability, and prognostic efficiency; and (iii) Creating a unified design framework that considers failure prognostics and mitigation/recovery in the early design stage. The primary applications of this research are renewable energy systems such as solar panels and wind turbines. Chao's research can help ease concerns about the reliability and availability of renewable energy systems by enabling robust failure prognostics and restoration, thus promoting the widespread deployment of clean energy solutions.
