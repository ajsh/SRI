Chris Rehmann works on problems of water resources and environmental fluid mechanics. Most of his research involves measuring and modeling the transport and mixing of contaminants in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Representative projects including modeling the fate and transport of E. coli  in streams and predicting concentrations of antibiotic resistance genes downstream of wastewater treatment plants. Other recent work related to the hazard mitigation and community resilience includes revising the model that the City of Ames uses to predict flooding and developing an agent-based model to study interactions between hydrology, climate, and strategic human decision making regarding flooding in a watershed.
