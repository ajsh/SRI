Ian Dobson studies blackouts of the electrical grid, particularly the cascading failures in which there is a complicated series of unusual dependent events that cause a widespread blackout across our national electric power transmission grid.  Cascading failures can be initiated by bad weather, earthquakes, equipment failure, human errors, and other causes, but can spread much further by interactions in the power grid. Since electrical power is essential for many other infrastructures, electrical blackouts can cascade into failures of other vital infrastructures such as water, transport and communications. Widespread blackouts greatly slow recovery efforts and put people's safety and our economy at risk. The largest widespread blackouts are rare, but their impact is high, so their risk is substantial. Ian uses methods from electrical engineering, risk analysis, statistical data analysis, physics, nonlinear dynamics, and complex systems to help understand and mitigate the risk of large blackouts.
