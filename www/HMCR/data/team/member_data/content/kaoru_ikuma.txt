My research expertise is in improving engineering processes using environmental biotechnology. As part of hazard mitigation, I am particularly interested in ensuring public health protection through resilient water and wastewater treatment processes and infrastructure as well as adequate remediation of indoor environmental hazards. Studying the recovery of water quality in watersheds following extreme events is also of interest as it will directly impact the community's access to clean water.
