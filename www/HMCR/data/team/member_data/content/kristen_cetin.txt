Dr Cetin's research efforts and interests focus on system-, building-, city-, and grid-scale resilience and sustainability. She has expertise in energy modeling, energy use prediction, and fault detection and diagnostics, using physics-based, grey-box and machine learning techniques, building smart grid integration and demand response techniques.  She also studies energy and non-energy benefits and motivational factors for building owners and cities to invest in sustainable and resilient technologies, as well as LCA, LCCA techniques. She current is PI several research projects funded by NSF, ASHRAE, Iowa Energy Center, and industry sponsors, and is a Co-PI on US EPA, Iowa DOT, and FAA projects, in collaboration with local and national industry and utility partners. This includes leading an NSF-funded project as PI, on the development of a framework to assess the impacts of extreme heat and drought on city-scale electricity production and consumption.  Dr Cetin is the Smart Grid subcommittee chair in ASHRAE TC 7.5 - Smart Building Systems, and is also a part of the ISU Sustainable Cities interdisciplinary research team.
