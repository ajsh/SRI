My main research specializations are post-disaster recovery and community resilience with two focus areas: housing recovery disparities and inequalities in recovery policy and planning. I conduct statistical and spatial analysis, system dynamics modelling, and apply deep learning techniques to answer different research questions in each of my focus areas. 
I also use qualitative data and methods extensively in my work.
