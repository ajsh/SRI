High Performance Control Systems are advanced mechanical devices and systems capable of high damping performance, ideal for mitigation of multihazards. Semi-active, hybrid, and active damping systems are HPCS. Specifically, our group is researching novel robust and reliable mechanical systems capable of high adaptability to a variety of loads, such as seismic, wind, and blast events. Examples include a variable friction device based on a band brake mechanism, and a semi-active cladding connection for leverage cladding systems in hazard mitigation.
